  Simple example snap to show how to receive journal messages from a device
  on a remote journal server.

  Currently only the http (not https!) protocol is supported, this will soon
  be extended.

  Log files can be found in /var/snap/logsync-receiver/current/
  And can be read with:

  sudo journalctl -f -D /var/snap/logsync-receiver/current/
